## Chapter2: Meaningful Names

### Use Intention-Revealing Names
The name should tell you why it exist, what it does, and how it is used.

**bad code**:
```java
int d; // elapsed time in days
```

We should choose a name that specifies what is being mesured and the unit of that measurement.

**good code**:
```java
int elapsedTimeInDays;
int daysSinceCreation;
int daysSinceModification;
int fileAgeInDays;
```

Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand and change code.

**bad code**:
```java
public List<int[]> getThem() {
    List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
    for (int[] x : theList)
        if (x[0] == 4)
            list1.add(x);
    return list1;
}
```

The code implicitly requires that we know the answers to questions such as:
1. What kinds of things are in `theList`?
2. What is the significance of the zeroth subscript of an item in `theList`?
3. What is the significance of the value `4`?
4. How would I use the list being returned?

Say that we're working in a mine sweeper game. We find that the board is list of cells called `theList`. Let's rename that to `gameBoard`.

Each cell on the board is represented by a simple array. We further find that the zeroth subscript is the location of a status value and that a status value of 4 means "flagged".

**good code**:
```java
public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
    List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
    for (int[] cell : gameBoard)
        if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
            flaggedCells.add(cell);
    return flaggedCells;
}
```

We can go further and write a simple class for cells instead of using an array of `int`s. It can include an intention-revealing function (call it `isFlagged`) to hide the magic numbers.

**good code**:
```java
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
    List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
    for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
        if (cell.isFlagged())
            flaggedCells.add(cell);
    return flaggedCells;
}
```

### Avoid Disinformation
Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a `List`, it may lead to false conclusions. So `accountGroup` or `bunchOfAccounts` or just plain `accounts` would be better.

Beware of using names which vary in small ways for example `XYZControllerForEfficientHandlerOfStrings` and `XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings`.

A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case `L` or uppercase `O` as variable names, especialy in combination. The problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one and zero.

**bad code**:
```java
int a = 1;
if (O == 1)
    a = O1;
else
    l = 01;
```

### Make Meaningful Distinctions
It is not sufficient to add number series or noise words, even though the compiler is satisfied. If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.

Consider, for example, the truly hideous practice of creating a variable named `klass` just because the name `class` was used for something else.

Number-series naming `(a1, a2, .. aN)` is the opposite of intentional naming.

**bad code**:
```java
public static void copyChars(char[] a1, char[] a2) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++)
        a2[i] = a1[i];
}
```

This function reads much better when `source` and `destination` are used for the argument names.

Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a `Product` class. If you have another called `ProductInfo` or `ProductData`, you have made names different without making them mean anything different. `Info` and `Data` are indistinct noise words like `a`, `an`, and `the`.

Noise words are redundant. The word `variable` should never appear in a variable name. The word `table` should never appear in a table name.

**bad code**:
```java
getActiveAccount();
getActiveAccounts();
getActiveAccountInfo();
```

How are the programmers in this project supposed to know which of these functions to call.

### Use Pronounceable Names
If you can't pronounce it, you can't discuss it without sounding like an idiot.

**bad code**:
```java
class DtaRcrd102 {
    private Date genymdhms; // generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute and second
    private Date modymdhms;
    private final String pszqint = "102";
}
```

**good code**:
```java
class Customer {
    private Date generationTimestamp;
    private Date modificationTimestamp;
    private final String recordId = "102";
}
```

### Use Searchable Names
My personal preference is that single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods.

> The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope.

If a variable or constant might be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name.

**bad code**:
```java
for (int j = 0; j < 34; j++)
    s += (t[j] * 4) / 5;
```

**good code**:
```java
int realDaysPerIdealDay = 4;
final int WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5;
int sum = 0;
for (int j = 0; j < NUMBER_OF_TASKS; j++) {
    int realTaskDays = taskEstimate[j] * realDaysPerIdealDay;
    int readlTaskWeeks = (realTaskDays / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK);
    sum += readlTaskWeeks;
}
```

### Avoid Encodings
Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type.

### Hungarian Notation
In days of old, compilers did not check types, so programmers needed a crutch to help them remember the types.

In modern languages we have much richer type systems, and compilers remember and enforce the types, so programmers don't need type encoding.

**bad code**:
```java
PhoneNumber phoneString; // name not changed when type changed!
```

### Member Prefixes
You also don't need to prefix member variables with `m_` anymore.

**bad code**:

```java
public class Part {
    private String m_desc; // The textual description
    void setName(String name) {
        m_desc = name;
    }
}
```

**good code**:
```java
public class Part {
    String description;
    void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
}
```

### Interfaces and Implementations
I prefer to leave interfaces unadorned. So if I must encode either the interface or the implementation, I choose the implementation. Calling it `ShapeFactoryImp`, or even the hideous `CShapeFactory`, is preferable to encoding the interface.

### Avoid Mental Mapping
This is a problem with single-letter variable names. Certainly a loop counter may be named `i` or `j` or `k` if its scope is very small and no other names can conflict with it. This is because those single-letter names for loop counters are traditional. However, in most other contexts a single-letter name is a poor choice; it's just a placeholder that the reader must mentally map to the actual concept. There can be no worse reason for using the name `c` than because `a` and `b` were already taken.

> One different between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that *clarity is king*. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

### Class Names
Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account` and `AddressParser`. Avoid words like `Manager`, `Processor`, `Data`, or `Info` in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

### Method Names
Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment`, `deletePage`, or `save`.

Accessors, mutators and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with `get`, `set`, and `is` according to the [javabean standard](http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs/spec.html).

**god code**:
```java
String name = employee.getName();
customer.setName("Farbod");
if (paycheck.isPosted()) {
    //...
}
```

When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments.

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
```

is generally better than:

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);
```

Consider enforcing their use by making the corresponding constructors private.

### Don't Be Cute
Choose clarity over entertainment value. For example. don't use the name `whack()` to mean `kill()`. Don't tell little culture-dependent jokes like `eatMyShorts()` to mean `abort()`.

> Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
